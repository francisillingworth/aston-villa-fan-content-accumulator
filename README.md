README for aston-villa-fan-content-accumulator

## Education tool

This website is an educational build allowing the creator to implent the html and css skills learned 

### Purpose of the website 

The idea behind this website is to provide a single place for someone to find all the aston villa fan made content online.
The principle is that a verified fan content maker will be able to sign in and upload links to thier content (be this their blogs, youtube channels etc)
This will increase traffic to these sites as people may not come across them during thier web searches. Some people will be already subscribed to some channels without the knowledge that other channels exist so this will broaden peoples knowledge of the content available
The website is simple. There are currently 3 forms of fan content: Blogs, podcasts and videos. 
This website will provide links only for blog posts. Regarding podcasts and videos the upload forms will allow content creators to post embed links on the website so this content can be viewed without leaving the website


### Future of the website

As things stand the website will rely on content creators posting their links themselves. As I move forward with my development I would like to have this automated so as content creators who are registered with the website update thier channels, blogs etc they automatically update on the website in a similar way to how newsnow.co.uk works
